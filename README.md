# Speaker-Recognition
A group project assignment of Speech Recognition Lecture Class
Consisting:
- Wilbert
- Fendy
- Leonardo


In this project, we are creating a speaker recognition model with machine learning model (SVM and XGBOOST) and a deep learning model (RNN). The dataset was built by combining student voice data and voice data from Kaggle. 
The voice data taken from 4 students, as well as 3 rest of the audios are from 3 different speakers sourced from Kaggle.
